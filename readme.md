| **Where** | 164 Angell St. floor 4 Innovation Zone |
| **When**  | Friday, April 5th 10:30-12:30          |
| **Who**   | The workshop is aimed at MEG/EEG researchers getting started with analyzing data in MNE-Python.|
| **Why**   | [MNE-Python](https://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html) is an open source software package to analyze, visualize, and explore electro-/magnetoencephalography (M/EEG) data. The package is written in Python which has a growing scientific ecosystem (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, pandas) and is popular as a clean and versatile language.|

Each day is a 1.5 to 2 hours hands-on introduction
to MNE-Python.

Here's a brief break-down of what's coming up:
* Day 1: [Raw to evoked](raw_to_evoked/readme.md)
* Day 2: [Preprocessing](preprocessing/readme.md)
* Day 3: [Source Modeling](evoked_to_stc/readme.md)

Buttons
-------

At the top of each notebook, there are two buttons labeled
"Download" and "Interact".

The download button allows you to
save it to disk and run it on your computer. The interact
button is a link to a mybinder instance, so you can play
around with the code in the browser without having to install
anything. Note that it may take a while to load -- sometimes
4 to 5 minutes.
